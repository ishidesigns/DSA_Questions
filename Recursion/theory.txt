Recursion 
-> When a function calls itself again and again until a specified condition (base condition) is met.
-> function call stack is used in backend. (Stack overflow error comes when numerous function calls are waiting due to recursion)

Recursion in Subsequence
-> subsequence is a contiguous/ non-contiguous part of a sequence following the order of original sequence.
-> no. of subsequences = 2^ n where n is length of sequence;
-> example = "312" -> "", "3", "1", "2", "31", "32", "12", "312".
